# DesignResourcesKit

## What is it?
`DesignResourcesKit` is a narrowly scoped Swift package continating the implementation of design system elements for iOS and macOS apps. This currently only includes colors and typography.
  
## Making changes
Any changes to the actual content of this package (e.g. values or names of colors, font sizes or leading etc.) should only be made if the changes are applied across the design system. 
If a design contains typography or colors not in this package, they should either be changed to use something in this package, or those new colors/type styles should be added fully to the design system.
